    "* All input parameters must be type-annotated. GTScript offers the type descriptor `Field` for data fields. This descriptor is parametric in the data-type. All basic Python and NumPy data-types are supported.\n",
    "* The function adopts an object-oriented interface: its signature includes both read-only fields (`b`) and fields to be computed (`b`). Scalar arguments can also be passed as keyword arguments (see below).\n",
    "* Any computation must be enclosed in a **computation block**. Computation blocks are defined as one or multiple assignments (or **stages**) wrapped within a `with` statement. The `with` construct is used in combination with two context managers: `computation()` and `interval()`. These specify the vertical iteration order and vertical region of application and will be explained later.\n",
    "* Neighboring points are accessed through the corresponding **offsets**, i.e. the relative displacements with respect to the current point. Offsets are signed integers. The syntax is `[x_offset, y_offset, z_offset]`. So `[0, 0, 0]` indicates the current location `[i, j, k]`, `[1, 0, 0]` stands for the point `[i+1, j, k`], `[0, -2, 1]` for `[i, j-2, k+1]`, and so on.\n",
    "* Note that for loops are abstracted away and computations are defined for a single grid point. Each stage can be thought of as the body of an `ij`-loop. Then stages in the same computation block can be thought of as `ij`-loops enclosed in the same `k`-loop. Loop bounds will be specified when actually calling the stencil (running the function)."

    "### Storages\n",

    "\n",
    "The storages subclass `numpy.ndarray`. (Side-note for Python experts: This will change soon, since inheriting from a `numpy.ndarray` is considered not-so-good practice nowadays. Adhering to [NEP 18](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html), storages will be coded as duck-arrays which implement the `__array_function__` protocol). So storages feature the same high-level API of NumPy arrays and should work in principle with any NumPy function which performs element-wise operations (e.g. `numpy.sin`, `numpy.exp`, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface hides as much as possible all low-level and backend-specific details, like the memory layout, strides, padding, etc.. All these aspects are handled internally by GT4Py in a trasparent fashion. Particularly, when using the `gtcuda` backend to run stencil computations on a GPU, GT4Py allocates and handles two buffers: one in CPU memory and one in GPU memory. The two buffers are exposed to the user as they were a single memory address. The synchronization between them is carried out in a *lazy* fashion, thus avoiding useless memory transfers. If the user needs to operate on the storage from the CPU side, then data are automatically copied from the GPU to the CPU **if and only if** the GPU buffer is *dirty*, i.e. if the GPU buffer has changed more recently than its CPU counterpart. Viceversa, when the storage is requested from the GPU side then data are transfered from the CPU to the GPU whenever the CPU buffer is dirty. This ensures that stencil computations are performed on the correct data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The module `gt4py.storage` exposes useful utilities to either allocate a GT4Py storage, or convert a `numpy.ndarray` into a GT4Py storage. When creating a storage, care should be taken to the so-called `default_origin`. This represents the element which is aligned in memory.\n",
